The most recent discussion I had with codex was the following. Please use these notes as informative context, so you can catch up and we can re-start the conversation accordingly.

# Topic: Cache handling adjustments and session note tracking

## User desires
Commit the `.codex/latest-session.md` session note file so future work recognizes it, and consider updating the session instructions if helpful.

## Specifics of user desires
Ensure the repository tracks the `.codex/latest-session.md` file that logs conversations. Optionally refine the guidance in `agents.md` if that helps keep the file maintained going forward.

## Actions taken
- Planned to create the `.codex` directory and add `latest-session.md` with the required template content.

## Helpful hints about conversation & relevant code paths:
- Session note requirements are documented in `agents.md` at the repository root.

With this context in mind, I have a follow up query:
