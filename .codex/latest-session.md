The most recent discussion I had with codex was the following. Please use these notes as informative context, so you can catch up and we can re-start the conversation accordingly.

# Topic: Ensuring mido is available for MIDI scanning

## User desires
Make onboarding seamless by documenting dependencies, shipping a requirements file, and automatically installing `mido` at runtime if it is missing so `.mid` scans never fail.

## Specifics of user desires
Add a `requirements.txt` that lists external libraries (notably `PySide6` and `mido`), update the README installation steps to point to `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and modify `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` to attempt importing `mido`, auto-install it with pip when unavailable, and retry the import so the GUI can launch successfully.

## Actions taken
- Created `requirements.txt` with `PySide6` and `mido` so developers can install everything in one step.
- Adjusted the README installation instructions to recommend `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Added `_ensure_mido_installed()` in `__main__.py` that imports `mido`, installs it on demand via pip when absent, and reruns the import before creating the Qt application.
- Verified the package compiles by running `python -m compileall ch_career_mode` and committed the changes.

## Helpful hints about conversation & relevant code paths:
- `requirements.txt` at the project root now tracks runtime dependencies.
- The README installation section documents the new workflow for setting up dependencies.
- `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` contains the runtime auto-install guard for `mido`.

With this context in mind, I have a follow up query:
