The most recent discussion I had with codex was the following. Please use these notes as informative context, so you can catch up and we can re-start the conversation accordingly.

# Topic: PyInstaller entry point wrapper for background scans

## User desires
Create a dedicated PyInstaller-friendly launcher so frozen builds avoid spawning extra GUI windows while keeping normal `python -m ch_career_mode` execution unchanged.

## Specifics of user desires
Add a root-level `app_entry.py` that imports `main` from `ch_career_mode.__main__`, wraps execution in an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block with `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`, and document that it's solely for PyInstaller on Windows. Update README build instructions to point PyInstaller at the new script.

## Actions taken
- Added `app_entry.py` with the freeze-support guard and explanatory comment while delegating to the package main function.
- Updated the README to reference the new PyInstaller command (`pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile app_entry.py`).
- Re-ran `python -m compileall ch_career_mode` to ensure the package still compiles without syntax issues.

## Helpful hints about conversation & relevant code paths:
- `app_entry.py` should be used when building Windows executables with PyInstaller to avoid multiprocessing GUI duplication.
- `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` remains the entry point for standard module execution (`python -m ch_career_mode`).

With this context in mind, I have a follow up query:

# Session 1 â€” 2025-09-25 09:38

## Topic
Relocate and redesign NPS scan progress bar in settings UI.

## User Desires
Make the NPS scan status more prominent and associated with the selected directory in the settings panel.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Move the existing NPS scan progress UI directly beneath the directory label in `gui.py`.
- Ensure the progress bar spans the width of the directory label, showing progress during scans.
- After completion, display a "NPS scan complete" label instead of the bar.
- Remove the old small progress indicator at the bottom of the settings panel while keeping signals intact.

## Actions Taken
- Reviewed repository instructions and prepared to modify `gui.py` accordingly.

## Helpful Hints
- Signals `nps_progress`, `nps_update`, and `nps_done` already manage state changes; only widget placement and behavior need adjustment.
