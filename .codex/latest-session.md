The most recent discussion I had with codex was the following. Please use these notes as informative context, so you can catch up and we can re-start the conversation accordingly.

# Topic: PyInstaller entry point wrapper for background scans

## User desires
Create a dedicated PyInstaller-friendly launcher so frozen builds avoid spawning extra GUI windows while keeping normal `python -m ch_career_mode` execution unchanged.

## Specifics of user desires
Add a root-level `app_entry.py` that imports `main` from `ch_career_mode.__main__`, wraps execution in an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block with `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`, and document that it's solely for PyInstaller on Windows. Update README build instructions to point PyInstaller at the new script.

## Actions taken
- Added `app_entry.py` with the freeze-support guard and explanatory comment while delegating to the package main function.
- Updated the README to reference the new PyInstaller command (`pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile app_entry.py`).
- Re-ran `python -m compileall ch_career_mode` to ensure the package still compiles without syntax issues.

## Helpful hints about conversation & relevant code paths:
- `app_entry.py` should be used when building Windows executables with PyInstaller to avoid multiprocessing GUI duplication.
- `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` remains the entry point for standard module execution (`python -m ch_career_mode`).

With this context in mind, I have a follow up query:

## Topic
Safeguard the tier builder width during startup and resizing.

## User Desires
Guarantee the window opens wide enough for all tier columns while preserving layout balance and fallback behavior when space is constrained.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Apply the main window minimum size before the initial resize so launch dimensions accommodate three tier columns.
- Re-run `_update_size_constraints()` after rebuilding tier widgets and resize the window when runtime changes drop below the minimum width.
- Provide horizontal scrolling as a fallback whenever the window ends up narrower than required so columns never disappear silently.

## Actions Taken
- Set the minimum window size prior to the first resize in `MainWindow.__init__` and triggered a constraints refresh immediately after rebuilding tiers.
- Extended `_update_size_constraints()` to capture the pre-adjust width, enforce the minimum width via `resize`, and reapply the global minimum size guard.
- Toggled the tier scroll area's horizontal policy based on the pre-adjust width so users can pan to hidden columns if the window shrinks below the minimum.

## Helpful Hints
- Call `_update_size_constraints()` whenever tier counts or window metrics change to keep scroll behavior and minimums aligned.
- Adjust `WINDOW_MIN_WIDTH` alongside `TIER_COLUMN_MIN_WIDTH` if future designs introduce more or narrower columns.
- The scroll area uses `Qt.ScrollBarAsNeeded` only when the width dips below the minimum, preserving the clean appearance under normal sizing.

## Topic
Material-themed redesign of main window with inline scan progress.

## User Desires
Restyle the PySide6 GUI to feel modern and cohesive, embed scan progress within the settings pane, and keep every existing feature intact.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Apply a dark Fluent/Material theme with accent highlights and consistent styling for buttons, inputs, and lists.
- Group Scan/Auto-Arrange/Export into a prominent accent button row and introduce collapsible settings sections.
- Replace the modal `QProgressDialog` with an inline progress indicator and add search/sort enhancements to the library list.
- Polish tier cards with icons, shadows, and expand/collapse behavior while preserving drag-and-drop and double-click removal.

## Actions Taken
- Rebuilt `MainWindow.__init__` to create card-based panels, an accent action row, search toolbar, toolbox settings groups, and styled library summary/footer.
- Introduced a persistent dark theme stylesheet, refreshed tier card construction with toggles and icons, and added hover/rounded styling across widgets.
- Embedded a cancelable scan progress bar under the folder picker, wired new status update helpers, and removed the old `QProgressDialog` usage.
- Added library sorting modes, inline song count updates, enhanced NPS status framing, and ensured responsive sizing plus drop shadow polish.

## Helpful Hints
- Use `_update_scan_progress_value`, `_update_scan_status`, and `_reset_scan_progress_ui` when extending scan behaviors.
- Tier headers rely on `TIER_HEADER_COLORS`; adjust these arrays for alternate accent palettes.
- The library footer updates via `_update_library_summary()`—call it after any manual list mutations.

# Session 1 — 2025-09-25 09:38

## Topic
Relocate and redesign NPS scan progress bar in settings UI.

## User Desires
Make the NPS scan status more prominent and associated with the selected directory in the settings panel.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Move the existing NPS scan progress UI directly beneath the directory label in `gui.py`.
- Ensure the progress bar spans the width of the directory label, showing progress during scans.
- After completion, display a "NPS scan complete" label instead of the bar.
- Remove the old small progress indicator at the bottom of the settings panel while keeping signals intact.

## Actions Taken
- Reviewed repository instructions and prepared to modify `gui.py` accordingly.

## Helpful Hints
- Signals `nps_progress`, `nps_update`, and `nps_done` already manage state changes; only widget placement and behavior need adjustment.

# Session 2 — 2025-09-25 10:15

## Topic
Rebalance main window layout widths and regroup settings controls.

## User Desires
Ensure the tier builder remains fully visible, keep settings from collapsing, and reorganize settings content into logical sections without losing functionality.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Tie the tier builder width to `TIER_COLUMNS * TIER_COLUMN_MIN_WIDTH` so tiers aren't truncated at launch and resize smoothly.
- Enforce sensible minimums for the workflow/settings column, keep the library column near `LIBRARY_MIN_WIDTH`, and adjust stretch factors.
- Replace the QToolBox accordion with Setup, Filters, and Rules groupings matching the requested control arrangements.

## Actions Taken
- Introduced `MainWindow._create_settings_section` to build styled sections and rebuilt the settings panel with Setup, Filters, and Rules groups per spec.
- Applied explicit minimum/maximum widths to the library, tier builder, and settings cards, updated `_update_size_constraints`, and set main layout stretch factors.
- Seeded tier scroll minimum widths from the column constants so the builder is fully visible initially and during resizing.

## Helpful Hints
- `_create_settings_section` centralizes styling for future settings groups—pass the desired layout class when adding new sections.
- `_update_size_constraints` re-applies card minimums after state changes; call it after altering column counts or resizes.
- Adjust `LIBRARY_MIN_WIDTH`, `SETTINGS_MIN_WIDTH`, or `TIER_COLUMN_MIN_WIDTH` for global layout tweaks without touching widget construction.

# Session 3 — 2025-09-25 10:45

## Topic
Rollback window refactor to material-themed baseline.

## User Desires
Restore the GUI implementation to the state captured in commit e07301b after being unhappy with later adjustments.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Discard the follow-up layout tweaks introduced after the material redesign.
- Ensure `gui.py` matches the visuals and logic present in commit e07301b.
- Keep all existing functionality intact after rolling back.

## Actions Taken
- Fetched upstream history to locate commit e07301b requested by the user.
- Checked out the `gui.py` snapshot from commit e07301b so the UI matches that baseline.
- Prepared to rerun compilation checks to confirm the project still builds.

## Helpful Hints
- Future tweaks should branch from commit e07301b to preserve the material-themed baseline the user prefers.
- Use `git fetch https://github.com/xdtrammell/CH-Career-Mode.git` to pull additional commits if more history is required.

# Session 5 — 2025-10-02 09:23

## Topic
Buffer the launch width so tier columns remain visible by default.

## User Desires
Keep all three tier columns visible when the window opens while preserving existing minimum-size and scrolling safeguards.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Increase the default window width beyond `WINDOW_MIN_WIDTH` to provide a small buffer for the tier builder.
- After applying size constraints during initialization, ensure the window width is still at least the requested minimum.
- Maintain the horizontal scroll fallback inside `_update_size_constraints()` without altering other behaviors.

## Actions Taken
- Updated `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE` to add a 40px buffer above `WINDOW_MIN_WIDTH` so the default resize fits all columns comfortably.
- Added a startup check after `_update_size_constraints()` to expand the window to `WINDOW_MIN_WIDTH + 40` if initialization left it narrower.
- Left `_update_size_constraints()` logic intact so the horizontal scroll fallback remains available when users shrink the window.

## Helpful Hints
- Adjust the buffer in `DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE` if tier column minimum widths or panel minimums change in the future.
- Call `_update_size_constraints()` whenever column counts change so the guard check can reapply the buffered width.

# Session 6 — 2025-10-02 09:55

## Topic
Recalculate minimum widths so the tier builder's third column is visible on launch.

## User Desires
Guarantee all three tier columns render without truncation at startup while preserving the dark themed layout and existing safeguards.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Increase the effective minimum width by accounting for card padding so the tier card cannot collapse and hide a column.
- Keep prior minimum-size enforcement and horizontal scrolling logic intact as a fallback when users shrink the window.
- Maintain the buffered default window size introduced earlier while ensuring derived constants reflect actual layout needs.

## Actions Taken
- Introduced shared card padding constants and updated the window minimum width calculation to include library and tier card margins.
- Applied the padding constants to card layout margins, persisted references to the library and tier panels, and enforced their minimum widths.
- Reused the derived panel widths inside `_update_size_constraints()` so the tier scroll area and card maintain the space required for all columns.

## Helpful Hints
- Adjust `CARD_CONTENT_MARGIN` if card padding changes to keep window and panel width calculations aligned.
- When modifying tier layout margins or column counts, update `TIERS_PANEL_MIN_WIDTH` so `_update_size_constraints()` stays accurate.

# Session 7 — 2025-10-02 10:25

## Topic
Account for window decorations when sizing the main window.

## User Desires
Ensure the tier builder's third column is always visible at startup by padding the window width for OS chrome while keeping the existing safeguards.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Replace the fixed default resize with logic that measures window decorations and adds an appropriate safety buffer.
- Apply the same padded width inside `_update_size_constraints()` whenever the window is forced back to its minimum size.
- Retain the horizontal scroll fallback so users can still reach hidden columns after manually shrinking the window.

## Actions Taken
- Added a `_decoration_padding()` helper and used it during initialization to expand the window width by the larger of the measured chrome or a 40px buffer.
- Updated `_update_size_constraints()` to reuse the padded width whenever it corrects a too-small window.
- Kept the existing horizontal scroll toggle so users who resize below the minimum can still access all tier columns.

## Helpful Hints
- The `_decoration_padding()` helper should be reused if future features need to guarantee full column visibility after dynamic layout changes.
- If tier column counts change, update the underlying constants before relying on the padding helper to avoid stale minimums.

# Session 8 — 2025-10-02 09:51

## Topic
Recalculate tier panel minimum width using explicit layout margins.

## User Desires
Ensure the tier builder columns are fully visible at launch by correcting the width calculation to include the tiers layout margin.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Define a shared constant for the tier grid layout margin instead of relying on hardcoded literals.
- Incorporate the margin into the tier panel minimum width computation so the third column is never clipped.
- Update the layout configuration to reference the new constant for consistency.

## Actions Taken
- Added `TIER_GRID_LAYOUT_MARGIN` and reused it when configuring the tier grid layout margins.
- Expanded `TIERS_PANEL_MIN_WIDTH` to include both sides of the tier grid margin in its formula.
- Retained existing safeguards and tests to confirm the GUI module still compiles.

## Helpful Hints
- Any future change to the tier grid spacing should update `TIER_GRID_LAYOUT_MARGIN` to keep derived widths in sync.
- Verify `_update_size_constraints()` if additional padding constants are introduced so the enforced widths remain accurate.
