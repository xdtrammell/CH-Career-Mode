The most recent discussion I had with codex was the following. Please use these notes as informative context, so you can catch up and we can re-start the conversation accordingly.

# Topic: PyInstaller entry point wrapper for background scans

## User desires
Create a dedicated PyInstaller-friendly launcher so frozen builds avoid spawning extra GUI windows while keeping normal `python -m ch_career_mode` execution unchanged.

## Specifics of user desires
Add a root-level `app_entry.py` that imports `main` from `ch_career_mode.__main__`, wraps execution in an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block with `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`, and document that it's solely for PyInstaller on Windows. Update README build instructions to point PyInstaller at the new script.

## Actions taken
- Added `app_entry.py` with the freeze-support guard and explanatory comment while delegating to the package main function.
- Updated the README to reference the new PyInstaller command (`pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile app_entry.py`).
- Re-ran `python -m compileall ch_career_mode` to ensure the package still compiles without syntax issues.

## Helpful hints about conversation & relevant code paths:
- `app_entry.py` should be used when building Windows executables with PyInstaller to avoid multiprocessing GUI duplication.
- `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` remains the entry point for standard module execution (`python -m ch_career_mode`).

With this context in mind, I have a follow up query:

## Topic
Material-themed redesign of main window with inline scan progress.

## User Desires
Restyle the PySide6 GUI to feel modern and cohesive, embed scan progress within the settings pane, and keep every existing feature intact.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Apply a dark Fluent/Material theme with accent highlights and consistent styling for buttons, inputs, and lists.
- Group Scan/Auto-Arrange/Export into a prominent accent button row and introduce collapsible settings sections.
- Replace the modal `QProgressDialog` with an inline progress indicator and add search/sort enhancements to the library list.
- Polish tier cards with icons, shadows, and expand/collapse behavior while preserving drag-and-drop and double-click removal.

## Actions Taken
- Rebuilt `MainWindow.__init__` to create card-based panels, an accent action row, search toolbar, toolbox settings groups, and styled library summary/footer.
- Introduced a persistent dark theme stylesheet, refreshed tier card construction with toggles and icons, and added hover/rounded styling across widgets.
- Embedded a cancelable scan progress bar under the folder picker, wired new status update helpers, and removed the old `QProgressDialog` usage.
- Added library sorting modes, inline song count updates, enhanced NPS status framing, and ensured responsive sizing plus drop shadow polish.

## Helpful Hints
- Use `_update_scan_progress_value`, `_update_scan_status`, and `_reset_scan_progress_ui` when extending scan behaviors.
- Tier headers rely on `TIER_HEADER_COLORS`; adjust these arrays for alternate accent palettes.
- The library footer updates via `_update_library_summary()`—call it after any manual list mutations.

# Session 1 — 2025-09-25 09:38

## Topic
Relocate and redesign NPS scan progress bar in settings UI.

## User Desires
Make the NPS scan status more prominent and associated with the selected directory in the settings panel.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Move the existing NPS scan progress UI directly beneath the directory label in `gui.py`.
- Ensure the progress bar spans the width of the directory label, showing progress during scans.
- After completion, display a "NPS scan complete" label instead of the bar.
- Remove the old small progress indicator at the bottom of the settings panel while keeping signals intact.

## Actions Taken
- Reviewed repository instructions and prepared to modify `gui.py` accordingly.

## Helpful Hints
- Signals `nps_progress`, `nps_update`, and `nps_done` already manage state changes; only widget placement and behavior need adjustment.

# Session 2 — 2025-09-25 10:15

## Topic
Rebalance main window layout widths and regroup settings controls.

## User Desires
Ensure the tier builder remains fully visible, keep settings from collapsing, and reorganize settings content into logical sections without losing functionality.

## Specifics of User Desires
- Tie the tier builder width to `TIER_COLUMNS * TIER_COLUMN_MIN_WIDTH` so tiers aren't truncated at launch and resize smoothly.
- Enforce sensible minimums for the workflow/settings column, keep the library column near `LIBRARY_MIN_WIDTH`, and adjust stretch factors.
- Replace the QToolBox accordion with Setup, Filters, and Rules groupings matching the requested control arrangements.

## Actions Taken
- Introduced `MainWindow._create_settings_section` to build styled sections and rebuilt the settings panel with Setup, Filters, and Rules groups per spec.
- Applied explicit minimum/maximum widths to the library, tier builder, and settings cards, updated `_update_size_constraints`, and set main layout stretch factors.
- Seeded tier scroll minimum widths from the column constants so the builder is fully visible initially and during resizing.

## Helpful Hints
- `_create_settings_section` centralizes styling for future settings groups—pass the desired layout class when adding new sections.
- `_update_size_constraints` re-applies card minimums after state changes; call it after altering column counts or resizes.
- Adjust `LIBRARY_MIN_WIDTH`, `SETTINGS_MIN_WIDTH`, or `TIER_COLUMN_MIN_WIDTH` for global layout tweaks without touching widget construction.
