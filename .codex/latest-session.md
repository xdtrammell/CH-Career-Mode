The most recent discussion I had with codex was the following. Please use these notes as informative context, so you can catch up and we can re-start the conversation accordingly.

# Topic: PyInstaller compatibility for multiprocessing launch

## User desires
Prepare the application for PyInstaller builds so that multiprocessing workers do not create extra GUI windows on Windows.

## Specifics of user desires
Wrap the module entry point in an `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard, call `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` within it, and document that this is for PyInstaller + Windows compatibility while keeping the existing startup flow intact.

## Actions taken
- Imported `multiprocessing` in `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` and guarded the launch code with a freeze support call.
- Added a clarifying comment noting the change is to support PyInstaller-generated executables without altering normal execution.
- Re-ran `python -m compileall ch_career_mode` to confirm the module still compiles cleanly.

## Helpful hints about conversation & relevant code paths:
- `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` hosts the package entry point executed by `python -m ch_career_mode` and PyInstaller builds.
- `multiprocessing.freeze_support()` is required when freezing multiprocessing code on Windows to prevent duplicate process launches.

With this context in mind, I have a follow up query:
