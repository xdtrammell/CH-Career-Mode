The most recent discussion I had with codex was the following. Please use these notes as informative context, so you can catch up and we can re-start the conversation accordingly.

# Topic: PyInstaller entry point wrapper for background scans

## User desires
Create a dedicated PyInstaller-friendly launcher so frozen builds avoid spawning extra GUI windows while keeping normal `python -m ch_career_mode` execution unchanged.

## Specifics of user desires
Add a root-level `app_entry.py` that imports `main` from `ch_career_mode.__main__`, wraps execution in an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block with `multiprocessing.freeze_support()`, and document that it's solely for PyInstaller on Windows. Update README build instructions to point PyInstaller at the new script.

## Actions taken
- Added `app_entry.py` with the freeze-support guard and explanatory comment while delegating to the package main function.
- Updated the README to reference the new PyInstaller command (`pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile app_entry.py`).
- Re-ran `python -m compileall ch_career_mode` to ensure the package still compiles without syntax issues.

## Helpful hints about conversation & relevant code paths:
- `app_entry.py` should be used when building Windows executables with PyInstaller to avoid multiprocessing GUI duplication.
- `ch_career_mode/__main__.py` remains the entry point for standard module execution (`python -m ch_career_mode`).

With this context in mind, I have a follow up query:
