# Clone Hero Career Mode Builder

Clone Hero Career Mode Builder is a desktop tool that helps you design and export custom **career mode setlists** for [Clone Hero](https://clonehero.net/). It scans your Clone Hero songs library, automatically evaluates difficulty, and arranges songs into tiers that feel authentic to the classic Guitar Hero career progression.

## Features

- üéµ **Song Library Scanner**
  - Recursively scans your Clone Hero `songs` folder.
  - Extracts metadata (title, artist, charter, genre, length, difficulty).
  - Detects chart files (`.chart`, `.mid`) and verifies guitar parts exist.
  - Computes **Average and Peak Notes Per Second (NPS)** for true difficulty scoring.
  - Caches results in a local SQLite database for faster re-scans.

- üìä **Smart Difficulty Scoring**
  - Combines in-game difficulty ratings with song length and NPS values.
  - Optionally lowers Harmonix/Neversoft official chart difficulties for balance.
  - Marks and handles very long tracks differently when tiering.

- üèÜ **Automatic Tiering**
  - Auto-assigns songs into configurable tiers (like Guitar Hero setlists).
  - Options for:
    - Number of tiers and songs per tier
    - Genre grouping for balanced tiers
    - Limiting duplicate artists per tier
    - Keeping meme songs out of progression
    - Enforcing minimum difficulty per tier
    - Special ‚ÄúArtist Career Mode‚Äù to generate a career for one artist only

- üé® **Tier Naming Themes**
  - Built-in presets inspired by Guitar Hero careers (GH1, GH2, etc.).
  - Procedural generator for fresh tier names each run.
  - Custom/manual tier names supported.

- üñ±Ô∏è **Drag-and-Drop GUI**
  - Modern Qt-based interface (PySide6).
  - Search, filter, and drag songs between library and tiers.
  - Double-click to remove songs from tiers.
  - Adjustable themes and difficulty settings with instant feedback.

- üì¶ **Export to Clone Hero**
  - Exports arranged tiers into valid `.setlist` binary files.
  - Option to export one combined setlist or one `.setlist` per tier.
  - Includes built-in validation of setlist integrity.

- ‚ö° **Performance Optimizations**
  - Caches scan results and only updates changed songs.
  - Deduplicates charts by MD5 hash.
  - Runs scanning in a background thread with progress feedback.
